Game cloning of "SNAKE XENZIA" using python
here I have recreated 90's classic mobile device game "Snake Xenzia" using Python. Here the package pygame is used along with randomization. A small score card is also added, showing the score and snake chasing after the food, and if it takes one, the nail will answer. the same nail may bring the snake closer to death by accidenly touching it.
this time we can officially announce its bread i guess - PYTHON :)))
